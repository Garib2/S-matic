## 4. PRIMITIVES AND ATTRIBUTES
We can separate primitives into two classes: geometric primitives and image, or raster, primitives.

- gl.POINTS: Each vertex is displayed at a size of at least one pixel.
- gl.LINES: The line-segment type causes successive pairs of vertices to be interpreted as the endpoints of individual segments. Note that successive
segments usually are disconnected because the vertices are processed on a pairwise basis.
- gl.LINE_STRIP, gl.LINE_LOOP: If successive vertices (and line segments) are to be connected, we can use the line strip, or polyline form.
