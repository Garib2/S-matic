## 1. Linear Components
### 1.1 Representing Lines: Implicit Form

#### Implicit Form of a Line:
- A line is defined by the equation:
  $$ \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{X} = d $$
  where:
  - $$ \mathbf{n} = (n_0, n_1) $$: Normal vector to the line.
  - $$ \mathbf{X} = (x_0, x_1) $$: Points on the line.
  - $$ d $$: A scalar.

- If $$ \mathbf{P} $$ is a specific point on the line, then the equation becomes:
  $$ \mathbf{n} \cdot (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{P}) = 0 $$
  or equivalently:
  $$ \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{X} - d = 0, \quad \text{where } d = \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{P}. $$

- **Normal Form**: This representation is called the **normal form** of the line.

#### Direction Vector:
- The direction vector for the line is:
  $$ \mathbf{d} = (d_0, d_1) = (n_1, -n_0). $$

#### Partitioning the Plane:
- A line divides the plane into two **half-planes**:
  - **Positive Side**: $$ \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{X} - d > 0 $$
  - **Negative Side**: $$ \mathbf{n} \cdot \mathbf{X} - d < 0 $$

#### Unit Normal Vector:
- If $$ \mathbf{n} $$ is normalized (unit length), the line equation simplifies, and the direction vector $$ \mathbf{d} $$ is also unit length.

- Any point $$ \mathbf{X} $$ can be represented as:
  $$ \mathbf{X} = \mathbf{P} + y_0 \mathbf{\hat{d}} + y_1 \mathbf{\hat{n}}, $$
  where:
  - $$ y_0 = \mathbf{\hat{d}} \cdot (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{P}) $$
  - $$ y_1 = \mathbf{\hat{n}} \cdot (\mathbf{X} - \mathbf{P}) $$

  - **Positive Side**: $$ y_1 > 0 $$
  - **Negative Side**: $$ y_1 < 0 $$
  - **Line Itself**: $$ y_1 = 0 $$

#### Alternative Implicit Form:
- Another common representation of a line:
  $$ ax + by + c = 0 $$
  where:
  - $$ \mathbf{n} = [a, b] $$
  - $$ \mathbf{X} = [x, y] $$
  - $$ d = -c $$

- If $$ a^2 + b^2 = 1 $$, the equation is said to be **normalized**.

#### Normalization:
- To normalize the equation:
  $$ a^2 + b^2 = 1, $$
  multiply through by:
  $$ \frac{1}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} $$

#### Intuition for Coefficients:
- With normalization:
  - $$ a = \cos \alpha $$: x-component of the normal vector.
  - $$ b = \cos \beta $$: y-component of the normal vector.
  - $$ c = ||\mathbf{r}|| $$: Minimum (signed) distance from the line to the origin.

#### Visual Representation:
- **Figure 5.1**:
  - A line in the plane with normal vector $$ \mathbf{n} $$ and direction vector $$ \mathbf{d} $$.
  - The line extends infinitely in both directions.
- **Figure 5.2**:
  - The coefficients $$ a $$ and $$ b $$ represent the components of the normal vector $$ \mathbf{n} $$, and $$ c $$ is the shortest distance from the origin to the line.
