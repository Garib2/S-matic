## 1. INTRO.
### 1.1 MOTIVATION
- computing with points, vectors, and matrices
- Coordinate-based methods: 3가지 관점으로 해석될 문제
- transforming a 2D point(C): DeRose example
```C
float P[2];
float PPrime[2];
float M[2][2];
P[0] = x;
P[1] = y;
M[0][0] = 3; M[0][1] = 0;
M[1][0] = 0; M[1][1] = 2;
PPrime[0] = P[0] * M[0][0] + P[1] * M[1][0];
PPrime[1] = P[0] * M[0][1] + P[1] * M[1][1];
```
1. As a change of coordinates, which leaves the point unchanged geometrically, but changes the coordinate system (see Figure 2.1(a)).
2. As a transformation of the coordinate plane onto itself, which moves the point but leaves the coordinate system itself unchanged (see Figure 2.1(b)).
3. As a transformation from one plane to another (see Figure 2.1(c)).

As DeRose points out, these interpretations are not interchangeable: in the first interpretation, lengths and angles don’t change, but they can in the second and third.

### 1.2 Organization


## 2. Tuples
### 2.1 Definition
- a scalar: A single real number
- an ordered pair: (a scalar, a scalar)
- an ordered triple: $$ (a_1, a_2, a_3)$ $
- an ordered quadruple: $$ (a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4) $$
- an n-tuple: $$ (a_1, ... , a_n) $$

### 2.2 Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition/Subtraction**:  
  Addition and subtraction of tuples are defined element-wise, provided both tuples have the same number of elements. For two tuples:
  $$ a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n), \quad b = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n) $$  
  $$ a + b = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_n + b_n) $$  
  $$ a - b = (a_1 - b_1, a_2 - b_2, \ldots, a_n - b_n) $$  

- **Scalar Multiplication/Division**:  
  A tuple can be multiplied or divided by a scalar by applying the operation to each element:  
  $k \cdot a = (k \cdot a_1, k \cdot a_2, \ldots, k \cdot a_n)$  
  $\frac{a}{k} = \left( \frac{a_1}{k}, \frac{a_2}{k}, \ldots, \frac{a_n}{k} \right)$  

- **Tuple Multiplication**:  
  Multiplication between two tuples is less straightforward and depends on the context. There are different types of tuple multiplication, which will be addressed later in the chapter.

- **Collections of Tuples (Matrices)**:  
  Collections of tuples can be organized into matrices, which will be the subject of further discussion in this chapter.

## 3. Matrices
### Definition
- **Matrix**: A rectangular array of elements, typically real numbers or symbols.
- **Dimensions**:A matrix with $$m$$ rows and $$n$$ columns is denoted as $$m \times n$$.
- If $$m = n$$, the matrix is called **square**.

### 3.1 Notation and Terminology
- A matrix $$M$$ and its elements are represented as:
$$
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6 \\
7 & 8 & 9
\end{bmatrix}
$$
  - The subscripts $(i, j)$ are in **row, column** order.

- Alternatively, a generic matrix $A$ can be expressed as $$A = [a_{i,j}]$$, indicating that its elements are indexed as above.
### 3.2 Transposition
### Definition
- The **transpose** of an $$m \times n$$ matrix $$M$$ is formed by:
  - Taking the $$m$$ rows of $$M$$ and making them the columns of a new matrix.
  - This also makes the columns of $M$ become the rows of the new matrix.
- The transpose of $$M$$ is denoted as $M^T$.
- The size of $$M^T$$ will be $$n \times m$$.

### Intuition
- Transposing a matrix can be thought of as **rotating** the matrix about a diagonal line running from the upper-left to the lower-right.

### Example
If we have the following matrix $M$:
$$
M =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Its transpose, $M^T$, will be:
$$
M^T =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 \\
2 & 5 \\
3 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Properties of Matrix Transposition

Matrix transposition has several important properties:

1. **Transpose of a Product**:
   $$ (AB)^T = B^T A^T $$

2. **Transpose of a Transpose**:
   $$ (A^T)^T = A $$

3. **Transpose of a Sum**:
   $$ (A + B)^T = A^T + B^T $$

4. **Transpose of a Scalar Multiplication**:
   $$ (kA)^T = k(A^T) $$


### Notes:
- These properties are fundamental in matrix algebra and are frequently used in linear algebra, computer graphics, and machine learning.

## 4. Linear Systems
### 4.1 Linear Equations

#### Definition
Linear equations are equations where each term is either:
1. **Linear term**: The product of a real number and the first power of a variable.
2. **Constant term**: A real number.

#### Examples
Given the equations:
1. $$ 5x + 3 = 7 $$
2. $$ 2x_1 + 4 = 12 + 17x_2 - 5x_3 $$
3. $$ 6 - 12x_1 + 3x_2 = 42x_3 + 9 - 7x_1 $$

They can be rewritten as:
1. $$ 5x = 4 \quad \text{(one unknown)} $$
2. $$ 2x_1 - 12x_2 = 8 \quad \text{(two unknowns)} $$
3. $$ -5x_1 + 3x_2 - 42x_3 = 3 \quad \text{(three unknowns)} $$

Linear equations are categorized by the number of unknowns.

---

#### Standard Forms
1. One unknown:  
   $$ ax = c $$
2. Two unknowns:  
   $$ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 = c $$
3. \( n \) unknowns:  
   $$ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 + \cdots + a_nx_n = c $$

Where:
- $$ a, a_1, a_2, \dots, a_n $$ are real number coefficients.
- $$ x, x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n $$ are the unknowns.

---

#### Solving Linear Equations
1. **One Unknown**:  
   Given $$ ax = c $$, the solution is:  
   $$ x = \frac{c}{a} \quad \text{(provided \( a \neq 0 \))}. $$

2. **Two Unknowns**:  
   A solution is a pair $$ (x_1, x_2) $$ satisfying $$ a_1x_1 + a_2x_2 = c $$.  
   To solve:
   - Assign an arbitrary value to $$\( x_1 \) or \( x_2 \)$$.
   - Solve for the other variable.

   Example: Solve $$ 3x_1 + 2x_2 = 6 $$:
   - Assign $$ x_1 = 2 $$:  
     $$ 
     3(2) + 2x_2 = 6 \implies 6 + 2x_2 = 6 \implies 2x_2 = 0 \implies x_2 = 0.
     $$  
     Solution: $$ (2, 0) $$.
   - Assign $$ x_1 = 6 $$:  
     $$
     3(6) + 2x_2 = 6 \implies 18 + 2x_2 = 6 \implies 2x_2 = -12 \implies x_2 = -6.
     $$  
     Solution: $$ (6, -6) $$.

---

#### Geometric Intuition
For two unknowns, solutions form a line in a 2D Cartesian coordinate system.  
Example: The solutions to $$ 3x_1 + 2x_2 = 6 $$ lie on a line in the $$ x_1x_2 $$-plane.  
This property gives linear equations their name.




### 4.2 Linear Systems in Two Unknowns
### Linear Systems with Two Equations and Two Unknowns

#### General Form
A linear system of two equations with two unknowns can be written as:
$$
a_{1,1}x + a_{1,2}y = c_1
$$
$$
a_{2,1}x + a_{2,2}y = c_2
$$

#### Geometric Interpretation
Each equation represents a line in 2D space. The system of two equations corresponds to two lines, and there are three possible cases:

1. **The lines intersect at one point**:  
   The system has a single unique solution \( (x, y) \).

2. **The lines are parallel and do not intersect**:  
   The system has no solution.

3. **The lines coincide (overlap completely)**:  
   The system has infinitely many solutions.

#### Proportional Coefficients
The second and third cases (no solution or infinite solutions) occur when the coefficients of the equations are proportional:
$$
\frac{a_{1,1}}{a_{2,1}} = \frac{a_{1,2}}{a_{2,2}}
$$

The distinction between these cases depends on the proportionality of the constant terms:
1. **Infinite solutions**: All terms, including constants, are proportional:
   $$
   \frac{a_{1,1}}{a_{2,1}} = \frac{a_{1,2}}{a_{2,2}} = \frac{c_1}{c_2}
   $$
2. **No solution**: Coefficients are proportional, but constants are not:
   $$
   \frac{a_{1,1}}{a_{2,1}} = \frac{a_{1,2}}{a_{2,2}} \neq \frac{c_1}{c_2}
   $$

---

### Solution Method: Elimination Process

To solve the system using elimination:
1. **Make coefficients of one variable opposites**:  
   Multiply the two equations by appropriate factors so that the coefficients of one variable cancel when added.

2. **Add the equations**:  
   Eliminate one variable, leaving a single linear equation with one unknown.

3. **Solve for the remaining variable**:  
   Solve the resulting equation to find the value of the unknown.

4. **Substitute back**:  
   Substitute the solution into one of the original equations to form another single-variable equation.

5. **Solve for the second variable**:  
   Solve this equation to find the value of the second unknown.

---

#### Example
Given the system:
$$
2x + 3y = 5
$$
$$
4x - 6y = 10
$$

1. Multiply the first equation by 2:
   $$
   4x + 6y = 10
   $$

2. Add the equations:
   $$
   (4x - 6y) + (4x + 6y) = 10 + 10 \implies 8x = 20 \implies x = 2.5
   $$

3. Substitute \( x = 2.5 \) into the first equation:
   $$
   2(2.5) + 3y = 5 \implies 5 + 3y = 5 \implies 3y = 0 \implies y = 0
   $$

Solution: \( (x, y) = (2.5, 0) \).

--- 

#### Summary
The elimination process is a systematic method to solve linear systems. By eliminating one variable and solving step by step, we can find either:
1. A unique solution,
2. No solution (parallel lines),
3. Or infinite solutions (coincident lines).
