## 1. INTRO.
### 1.1 MOTIVATION
- computing with points, vectors, and matrices
- Coordinate-based methods: 3가지 관점으로 해석될 문제
- transforming a 2D point(C): DeRose example
```C
float P[2];
float PPrime[2];
float M[2][2];
P[0] = x;
P[1] = y;
M[0][0] = 3; M[0][1] = 0;
M[1][0] = 0; M[1][1] = 2;
PPrime[0] = P[0] * M[0][0] + P[1] * M[1][0];
PPrime[1] = P[0] * M[0][1] + P[1] * M[1][1];
```
1. As a change of coordinates, which leaves the point unchanged geometrically, but changes the coordinate system (see Figure 2.1(a)).
2. As a transformation of the coordinate plane onto itself, which moves the point but leaves the coordinate system itself unchanged (see Figure 2.1(b)).
3. As a transformation from one plane to another (see Figure 2.1(c)).

As DeRose points out, these interpretations are not interchangeable: in the first interpretation, lengths and angles don’t change, but they can in the second and third.

### 1.2 Organization


## 2. Tuples
### 2.1 Definition
- a scalar: A single real number
- an ordered pair: (a scalar, a scalar)
- an ordered triple: $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$
- an ordered quadruple: $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$
- an n-tuple: $(a_1, ... , a_n)$

### 2.2 Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition/Subtraction**:  
  Addition and subtraction of tuples are defined element-wise, provided both tuples have the same number of elements. For two tuples:
  $a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n), \quad b = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)$  
  $a + b = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_n + b_n)$  
  $a - b = (a_1 - b_1, a_2 - b_2, \ldots, a_n - b_n)$  

- **Scalar Multiplication/Division**:  
  A tuple can be multiplied or divided by a scalar by applying the operation to each element:  
  $k \cdot a = (k \cdot a_1, k \cdot a_2, \ldots, k \cdot a_n)$  
  $\frac{a}{k} = \left( \frac{a_1}{k}, \frac{a_2}{k}, \ldots, \frac{a_n}{k} \right)$  

- **Tuple Multiplication**:  
  Multiplication between two tuples is less straightforward and depends on the context. There are different types of tuple multiplication, which will be addressed later in the chapter.

- **Collections of Tuples (Matrices)**:  
  Collections of tuples can be organized into matrices, which will be the subject of further discussion in this chapter.


## 3. Matrices
### Definition
- **Matrix**: A rectangular array of elements, typically real numbers or symbols.

### Representation
- **Mechanistic view**: A "bag" of numbers with operational rules for manipulation.
- **Intuitive view**: 
  - Represented as **lists of tuples** or **tuples of tuples**.
  - Organized as:
    - A **top-to-bottom stack** of horizontally oriented tuples.
    - A **left-to-right grouping** of vertically oriented tuples.

### Notation
- Enclosed in square brackets, e.g.:
  - Example 1:
    $$
    \begin{equation}
    \begin{matrix}
    3.2 & 7 \\
    4 & 7 \\
    \end{matrix}
    \end{equation}
    $$
  - Example 2:
    $$
    \begin{bmatrix}
    93.5 \
    5 \
    9 \
    12 \
    \end{bmatrix}
    $$
