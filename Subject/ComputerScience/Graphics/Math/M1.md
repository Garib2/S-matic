## 1. INTRO.
### 1.1 MOTIVATION
- computing with points, vectors, and matrices
- Coordinate-based methods: 3가지 관점으로 해석될 문제
- transforming a 2D point(C): DeRose example
```C
float P[2];
float PPrime[2];
float M[2][2];
P[0] = x;
P[1] = y;
M[0][0] = 3; M[0][1] = 0;
M[1][0] = 0; M[1][1] = 2;
PPrime[0] = P[0] * M[0][0] + P[1] * M[1][0];
PPrime[1] = P[0] * M[0][1] + P[1] * M[1][1];
```
1. As a change of coordinates, which leaves the point unchanged geometrically, but changes the coordinate system (see Figure 2.1(a)).
2. As a transformation of the coordinate plane onto itself, which moves the point but leaves the coordinate system itself unchanged (see Figure 2.1(b)).
3. As a transformation from one plane to another (see Figure 2.1(c)).

As DeRose points out, these interpretations are not interchangeable: in the first interpretation, lengths and angles don’t change, but they can in the second and third.
- illicit operations: 점과 벡터는 구분되어야함(점의 덧셈연산은 기하학적 의미가 없다)

### 1.2 Organization


## 2. Tuples
### 2.1 Definition
- a scalar: A single real number
- an ordered pair: (a scalar, a scalar)
- an ordered triple: $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$
- an ordered quadruple: $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$
- an n-tuple: $(a_1, ... , a_n)$
