## 1. INTRO.
### 1.1 MOTIVATION
- computing with points, vectors, and matrices
- Coordinate-based methods: 3가지 관점으로 해석될 문제
- transforming a 2D point(C): DeRose example
```C
float P[2];
float PPrime[2];
float M[2][2];
P[0] = x;
P[1] = y;
M[0][0] = 3; M[0][1] = 0;
M[1][0] = 0; M[1][1] = 2;
PPrime[0] = P[0] * M[0][0] + P[1] * M[1][0];
PPrime[1] = P[0] * M[0][1] + P[1] * M[1][1];
```
1. As a change of coordinates, which leaves the point unchanged geometrically, but changes the coordinate system (see Figure 2.1(a)).
2. As a transformation of the coordinate plane onto itself, which moves the point but leaves the coordinate system itself unchanged (see Figure 2.1(b)).
3. As a transformation from one plane to another (see Figure 2.1(c)).

As DeRose points out, these interpretations are not interchangeable: in the first interpretation, lengths and angles don’t change, but they can in the second and third.

### 1.2 Organization


## 2. Tuples
### 2.1 Definition
- a scalar: A single real number
- an ordered pair: (a scalar, a scalar)
- an ordered triple: $(a_1, a_2, a_3)$
- an ordered quadruple: $(a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4)$
- an n-tuple: $(a_1, ... , a_n)$

### 2.2 Arithmetic Operations
- **Addition/Subtraction**:  
  Addition and subtraction of tuples are defined element-wise, provided both tuples have the same number of elements. For two tuples:
  $a = (a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n), \quad b = (b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n)$  
  $a + b = (a_1 + b_1, a_2 + b_2, \ldots, a_n + b_n)$  
  $a - b = (a_1 - b_1, a_2 - b_2, \ldots, a_n - b_n)$  

- **Scalar Multiplication/Division**:  
  A tuple can be multiplied or divided by a scalar by applying the operation to each element:  
  $k \cdot a = (k \cdot a_1, k \cdot a_2, \ldots, k \cdot a_n)$  
  $\frac{a}{k} = \left( \frac{a_1}{k}, \frac{a_2}{k}, \ldots, \frac{a_n}{k} \right)$  

- **Tuple Multiplication**:  
  Multiplication between two tuples is less straightforward and depends on the context. There are different types of tuple multiplication, which will be addressed later in the chapter.

- **Collections of Tuples (Matrices)**:  
  Collections of tuples can be organized into matrices, which will be the subject of further discussion in this chapter.

## 3. Matrices
### Definition
- **Matrix**: A rectangular array of elements, typically real numbers or symbols.
- **Dimensions**:A matrix with $m$ rows and $n$ columns is denoted as $m \times n$.
- If $m = n$, the matrix is called **square**.

### 3.1 Notation and Terminology
- A matrix $M$ and its elements are represented as:
  \[
  M =
  \begin{bmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n} \\
  \end{bmatrix}
  \]
  - The subscripts $(i, j)$ are in **row, column** order.

- Alternatively, a generic matrix $A$ can be expressed as $A = [a_{i,j}]$, indicating that its elements are indexed as above.
### 3.2 Transposition
### Definition
- The **transpose** of an $m \times n$ matrix $M$ is formed by:
  - Taking the $m$ rows of $M$ and making them the columns of a new matrix.
  - This also makes the columns of $M$ become the rows of the new matrix.
- The transpose of $M$ is denoted as $M^T$.
- The size of $M^T$ will be $n \times m$.

### Intuition
- Transposing a matrix can be thought of as **rotating** the matrix about a diagonal line running from the upper-left to the lower-right.

### Example
If we have the following matrix $M$:
$$
M =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 2 & 3 \\
4 & 5 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

Its transpose, $M^T$, will be:
$$
M^T =
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & 4 \\
2 & 5 \\
3 & 6
\end{bmatrix}
$$

## Properties of Matrix Transposition

Matrix transposition has several important properties:

1. **Transpose of a Product**:
   $ (AB)^T = B^T A^T $

2. **Transpose of a Transpose**:
   $ (A^T)^T = A $

3. **Transpose of a Sum**:
   $ (A + B)^T = A^T + B^T $

4. **Transpose of a Scalar Multiplication**:
   $(kA)^T = k(A^T)$


### Notes:
- These properties are fundamental in matrix algebra and are frequently used in linear algebra, computer graphics, and machine learning.
